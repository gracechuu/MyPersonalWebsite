            What is the purpose of this site?
        </h2>
        <p>I am currently creating this personal website as an assignment for one of my classes (IB Computer Science) but hopefully as 
            I complete more projects and start to amass a portfolio I can use this website for professional purposes. But for now, it'll 
            be a fun place for us to hang out! Currently in our class we have started to learn about the basics of HTML and we will soon 
            learn about CSS and Javascript. While I do have a prior base of knowledge on these topics, (albeit extremely limited), I look 
            forward to diving into these topics and learning more about the intricacies and nuances that come along with web design. 
        </p>
